//global object
-Similar to window in web dev
-when working in the browser the window is the global object


//_dirname and _filename
-gets you the absolute path of folder you are in and abosolute path of folder with filename added on at end


//things you don't have access to 
-document object querySelector method
-still have setTimeout and setInterval .....

//modules and require
-const varname = require('relative filepath')
    - this will run the file inside ()
-the var will be an empty object and you do not get access to the vars in the other file
-to get access from the relative file you have to export the stuff you want to get 
    -in the relative file you have to do this
    -module.exports = { name : var, name : var, functname : func, ----- }
    - varname will now be equal to what you exported
-could way to take stuff in is to destructure
    -const {samename , samename} = require('relative filepath')

//os built in
const os = require('os') //built in os node file
-to get operating system
    -os.platform()
-to get home dir 
    -os.homedir()
